# eCommerce

Hello, my name is Blamah Kotay.

This is mu eCommerce project made using HTML, CSS, Javascript and the foundations of the JSON file. My project is about a training programs and helping clients and athletes improve themselves physically and mentally!

Project Features
 * Grid Display
 * The use of Javascript and json to retrive and display products on the page
 * Validated Contact form
 * Made accessible for different device sizes.
 
 The use of the JSON objects was made useful to create the products displayed with the price, description and name. The fetch() method to gather it together. I used a darker design to relate to more of a mainstream idea when regarding to the topic of my project. If you want to see how it looks click the link below!
